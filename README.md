# Java OOP, Exercises, and Data Structures

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Explore the core principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Mastering OOP is crucial for writing well-organized and reusable Java code. You will see more about it in my other Java Repository, a [Chess Project](https://github.com/Axelvazslima/chess-java).

## Exercises
Challenge yourself with a variety of Java exercises. Strengthen your understanding of Java syntax, data manipulation, and problem-solving skills. Practice is key to becoming a proficient Java programmer.

## Data Structures
Discover essential data structures in Java, such as arrays, lists, maps, sets and etc. Understanding these structures is fundamental for efficient data handling and algorithm development.

## Generics<T>
Understand the power of Java generics and how they enable type-safe and reusable code. Learn to write flexible and parameterized classes and methods that work with different data types.
